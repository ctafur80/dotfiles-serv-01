Dotfiles management for my servers with GNU Stow. These servers are Ubuntu
Linux. So it's based on APT package manager.

The initial software in order you need to proceed and copy this settings is the
`git` CLI.

You must open a terminal session and then go to _/root_ dir. Then you copy or
clone the repo (<https://github.com/ctafur80/dotfiles-serv-01>) and `cd` into
its dir. Then run _script.sh_.

After installation and settings, It'd be better to del the repo dir on your
system.
