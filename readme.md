Dotfiles management for my servers with GNU Stow. These servers are Ubuntu
Linux. So it's based on APT package manager.

The initial software in order you need to proceed and copy this settings is the
`git` CLI. Then you must copy or clone this repo
(<https://github.com/ctafur80/dotfiles-serv-01>) and run the _script.sh_.
